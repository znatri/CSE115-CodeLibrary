# CSE115 Project 1 (For Educational Purposes Only)
## Spring 2020 edition
### Plagirism of this code can cause violation of Academic Integrity. You will solely be responsible for it.
In this project you will be shown how to incrementally build a small web application.  The application will be complete with a JavaScript visualization in the front end of the application, and a Python-based web server back end that provides cleaned and filtered data to the front end.

This project involves a significant amount of work.  The project is divided into four stages.  You'll need time to develop your code, ask questions, etc., so keep up to date to finish on time.

Grading: 60 points in total, divided up as amount submission targets as follows.


> Week 1 milestone: 4 points

> Week 2 milestone: 4 points

> Week 3 milestone: 4 points

> Week 4 final submission: 48 points (both automated and manual grading)

AutoLab will limit the number of times you submit to each of the submission targets; you will be able to make at most 5 (five) submissions to each.  We will count your last submission to AutoLab, even if that is not your highest scoring submission.  It is therefore very important for you to develop your own test cases and verify the correctness of your code on your own before you make a submission to AutoLab.

Please note: the tasks assigned for each week involve application of skills and concepts covered in class prior to that week.  Use what you have been taught.
